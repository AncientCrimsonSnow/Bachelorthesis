# Bachelorthesis: AI-Based Combat Simulation with Quadtree Structure using Unity

This repository contains the practical implementation of Juri Wiechmann's Bachelor's Thesis, focusing on combat simulation of AI-controlled entities using a quadtree data structure implemented in Unity. The thesis explores performance optimization through spatial partitioning.

## Project Overview

The thesis investigates the use of a quadtree structure to efficiently manage AI-controlled entities within a combat simulation in Unity. The goal is to optimize collision detection and pathfinding by dividing space into hierarchical regions.

**Key Components:**
- **Combat Simulation:** Implementation of a combat system using AI agents.
- **Quadtree Data Structure:** Efficient spatial partitioning to manage entities.
- **Unity Engine:** The entire project is implemented in Unity with ECS (Entity Component System).
